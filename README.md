# Insta
project for practicing Android

Instagram inspired app.

There are 4 main sections:
  - Feed: the users you follow - click on their name to be redirected to their profile where you can like photos / unfollow them.
  - Discover: see all the photos of any users signed in
  - Notifications: check if anyone liked your photos. Click on the notifications to delete them.
  - Profile: see your posted photos and customize your avatar.
  
The upper-right corner menu (three dots) also has three options:
  - Share: choose a photo from your galery, choose the right description and post it (or discard it).
  - Delete Photo: choose one of your posted photos and delete it (confirmation needed).
  - Logout: logging out of your profile redirects you to the signup/login screen, where you can create a new account or use yours.
